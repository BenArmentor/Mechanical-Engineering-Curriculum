# Mechanical-Engineering-Curriculum
This repository contains notes and/or code from my time at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical Engineering. The courses outlined are from the 2014-2016 course catalog, and some will be omitted.

When provided, support code will be primarily in Python. As of now, I am also planning on translating to C++, and possibly including Jupyter Notebooks for visual examples.

The current courses that are in progress are:
1) Thermodynamics

The current courses that are complete (without worked-out examples) are:
1) Calculus I

The current courses that I plan to complete are:
### Math
1) Calculus II
2) Calculus III
3) Differential Equations
4) Numerical Methods
5) Linear and Nonlinear Programming
6) Engineering Analysis (Graduate Level)
7) Data Analysis Statistics

### Solid Mechanics
1) Physics I
2) Physics II
3) Materials of Engineering
4) Statics
5) Dynamics
6) Mechanics of Materials
7) Kinematics of Machines
8) Vibrations
